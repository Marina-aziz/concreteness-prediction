# concreteness-prediction

A concreteness prediction model for a Master's thesis in Computational Linguistics. Uses word embeddings and KNN regression to estimate concreteness scores of words, with additional experiments using ChatGPT. Includes datasets and experiments for both Modern Standard Arabic and English.

## Abstract

This project investigates computational methods for estimating how concrete or abstract words are (for example, "apple" vs. "justice") in both Modern Standard Arabic and English. It introduces a novel dataset of 202 Arabic nouns with concreteness ratings and aligns these with established English norms. The main approach uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression with word embeddings, and compares the results to predictions from ChatGPT. The models are evaluated on held-out test sets, supporting applications in psycholinguistics and natural language processing.
